"""Prompts for ChartQA agent with reduced exposure bias.

This module implements a simplified 2-step pipeline:
1. Extract: Model looks at chart + question, extracts all relevant data as structured JSON
2. Compute: Given extracted data, compute the final answer

Instructions:
1. Identify what data is needed to answer the question
2. Read the values carefully from the chart
3. Output the extracted data as JSON

Output format:

Rules:
- Extract ONLY values needed to answer the question
- Use exact labels/categories from the chart
- For numbers, give your best estimate if not labeled
- Include units in notes if relevant (but not in values)""",

- Answer must be concise: a number OR max 3 words
- No units, %, or currency symbols in the answer
- If the question asks "which/what", return the label/name
- If the question asks "how many/much", return a number""",
